## Overview

This addon speeds up the interaction with the editor by x100 times - you no longer have to look at the names when you look for an object, because you can simply display the icon directly on the asset.

You can change scale of icon, and set background if needed.

*Also, if you have the [**Odin Inspector**](https://odininspector.com/) installed in your project, the icons will be displayed in any other fields of the inspector view. No additional settings are needed.*

### Install via GIT URL

Go to ```Package Manager``` -> ```Add package from GIT url...``` -> Enter ```https://github.com/fffogil/SimpleTools-CustomSOIcons.git``` -> Click ```Add```

You will need to have Git installed and available in your system's PATH.

## Usage

You have 3 ways to declare which icon to use for display.

**Fisrst way** - Simply mark any ```Sprite``` field or property in your SO class as ```[CustomAssetIcon]```

</p>

**Second way** - If you want to assign icon to read-only class that you cannot change, you can create another class anywhere inside your project, inherit it from the ```ICustomEditorIconDeclarator```, and get an icon.

</p>

**Third way** - For classes that you just want to assign an icon that won't change depending on the content, you can add override option in addon settings, which are in ```Assets/Resources```

*That's all! I'd appreciate it if you'd leave a star on the github.*
